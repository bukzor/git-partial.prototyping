properties:
  status:
    type: string
    enum: [todo, done, gap, equivalent]
    description: |
      todo - not yet attempted
      done - verified that an appropriately-named test fails when this is broken
      gap - injection caused no test failure; test coverage is deficient (requires Opus to write proper test)
      equivalent - mutation doesn't change behavior (not a bug); may reveal redundant code
  attempts:
    type: integer
    minimum: 0
    description: Number of times this mutation has been attempted (for gaps)
