# Discovered Constraints

Technical limitations found during exploration. Facts we must work within, not choices.

## What Belongs

- Git behavior that limits approaches
- Claude Code / environment limitations
- Ecosystem gaps (missing packages, APIs)

## What Does NOT Belong

- How we work around constraints (→ integration-patterns.kb/)
- Choices between alternatives (→ technology-choices.kb/)
