# Roadmap

See [docs/dev/milestones.kb/](docs/dev/milestones.kb/) for detailed milestone tracking.

## Quick Overview

- **010: Single-Session Core** - Prove isolated index workflow (happy path only)
- **020: Multi-Agent Persistence** - Session IDs, concurrent agents, eval-able export
- **030: Production Hardening** - Error handling, tests, documentation
- **040: Polish** - UX improvements, ecosystem integration (optional)

**"Done enough" target:** Milestone 020 solves the stated problem (multi-agent concurrent sessions).
