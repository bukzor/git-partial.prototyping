# Milestones

Project milestones for git-partial development.

## What Belongs

Each milestone defines:
- Completion criteria (what "done" means)
- Deliverable artifacts
- Dependencies on prior milestones
- Status tracking

## What Does NOT Belong

- Implementation details (→ design.kb/)
- Task breakdowns (use TodoWrite for active work)
- Retrospectives (→ docs/devlog/)

## When to Add

Add a new milestone when:
- Defining a significant capability increment
- Establishing a decision point for continuation
- Creating dependency relationships between work phases

## Numbering

Use 3-digit zero-padded multiples of 10 (010, 020, 030...) to allow insertion of intermediate milestones without renumbering.
